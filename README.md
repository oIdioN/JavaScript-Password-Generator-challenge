## Getting Started

This readme is built of an example of the "Best Readme Template" found in the wild and not the final version thereof.
https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/blob/master/BLANK_README.md

### Prerequisites

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

### Installation

As the charachterset consist several data types, the best is if these treated as strings, therefore the charachterpool rewritten as here:

```
const pool = {
  upperCase: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  lowerCase: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
  numbers: "0123456789",
  symbols: "!@#$%^&*()_+~\\`|}{[]:;?><,./-="
}
```
Special characters based on [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).
